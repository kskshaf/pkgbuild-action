# pkgbuild-action
GitHub action to build and check a PKGBUILD package

## Features
* Checks that .SRCINFO matches PKGBUILD if .SRCINFO exists
* Builds package(s) with makepkg (configurable arguments)
* Runs on a bare minimum Arch Linux install to help detect missing dependencies
* Outputs built package archives
* Checks PKGBUILD and package archives with [namcap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/namcap)

## Interface
Inputs:
* `pkgdir`: Relative path to directory containing the PKGBUILD file
            (repo root by default).
* `aurDeps`: Support AUR dependencies if nonempty.
* `namcapDisable`: Disable namcap checks if nonempty.
* `namcapRules`: A comma-separated list of rules for namcap to run.
* `namcapExcludeRules`: A comma-separated list of rules for namcap not to run.
* `makepkgArgs`: Additional arguments to pass to `makepkg`.

Outputs:
* `pkgfileN`: Filename of Nth built package archive (ordered as `makepkg --packagelist`).
   Empty if not built. N = 0, 1, ...
